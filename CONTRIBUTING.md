# Branches and Pull Requests

If you have a feature or fix you want to implement, create a branch in the form of
feature/{username}/{feature_name} and then develop on that branch. When committing to your
feature branch it is not required to follow "conventional commits". However, once you are
ready to merge back into develop you can squash your commits down to one commit that has a
message that uses conventional commits.

You can find how to do that here: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

# Styles
